Yey first commit ðŸš€

### Intentions

- Develop this [Chat Group challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/UgCqszKR7Q7oqb4kRfI0) using Phoenix LiveView
- Configure TailwindCSS on Phoenix, [using this method from Mike Clark](https://pragmaticstudio.com/tutorials/adding-tailwind-css-to-phoenix)
- Become a master testers with Elixir
- Test the upcoming Phoenix [authentication generator](https://github.com/aaronrenner/phx_gen_auth)
- Deploy to minikube early on, I want to sharpen my Helm skills
- Use pomodoro technique, I'm loving [this one for ubuntu](https://gnomepomodoro.org/). I've become an alttabber during the last few year, must break this habit

### Thoughts

Read [An upcoming authentication solution for Phoenix](https://dashbit.co/blog/a-new-authentication-solution-for-phoenix) by JosÃ© Valim, great writing as usual.
There I've found the [original pull request](https://github.com/dashbitco/mix_phx_gen_auth_demo/pull/1/files), really informative discussions.
One link that got my attention was [Password breach lookup and other password validation rules](https://powauth.com/guides/2019-09-14-password-breach-lookup-and-other-password-validation-rules.html), in example it cites rejecting "passwords obtained from previous data breaches". Neat stuff.

Configuring tailwind was a breeze, and the pomodoro is working really well in keeping me focused.
